# GENAI Project

## Technology Stack

**Jekyll** - Static site generator using Ruby
- Processes Markdown content into clean HTML
- Template-based layout system
- Built-in development server with live reload

**Docker** - Containerization for local development
- Consistent environment across systems
- No local Ruby/Jekyll installation required
- Simple `docker-compose up` to start development

**Minimalistic Approach**
- Single layout file (`_layouts/default.html`)
- Inline CSS for immediate styling
- No external dependencies or complex build tools
- Under 20 lines of layout code

## Local Development
